# CPP11

## Scope of the project

This repository contains my course work for C11 and C++11 Programming (BMEVIEEAV01) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Problems regarded advanced and modern C++11/14/17 features and related OOP concepts such as: override and final keywords, virtual constructor, runtime type information, smart pointers, possibilities for implementing reflection, technical details of inheritance, heterogeneous collections, templates, I/O manipulators, memory model, stack and dynamic memory management, standard library and container classes, iterators, rvalue references, object copying and moving semantics, RAII, lambda functions, closures, parameter binding by value and reference, mutable lambdas, generic lambda functions, tools for template metaprogramming, compile-time evaluation, implementation of metafunctions, C++17 if constexpr, variadic template parameter lists, forwarding function arguments, universal references, reference collapsing, std::forward, factory functions, in-place creation, multithreading, threads, mutexes, atomic operations, async, future, and promise templates.

Some of the variable names and most of the comments are in Hungarian, but for the most part I strived to maintain an English-centered conding style even that early on.
